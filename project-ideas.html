    <b>Vector Space Models for Natural Language Processing</b><br />
    <br />
    Many tasks in natural language processing can be performed with only very shallow
    understanding of text. The vector space model is one example of a useful, but
    shallow, data representation that has been successfully used for many tasks,
    including detecting synonyms, finding analogies, and learning properties of noun
    phrases. The vector space model represents the meaning of a noun phrase(NP) (e.g.
    "the New York Yankees" or "house") as a vector of co-occurrence counts with
    contexts. A context is a short snippet of text like "alex rodriguez plays for _" or
    "_ on the street". The model is essentially a (very) large matrix A, whose rows
    represent noun phrases and whose columns represent contexts. The value of entry
    A_{i,j} is the number of times noun phrase i occurred with context j in a large
    corpus of documents (e.g., the Web). Intuitively, this model contains useful
    information because some contexts only occur with certain types of noun phrases;
    for example, the context "athletes, such as _" only occurs with athletes.<br />

    <u>Project ideas:</u><br />
    In this project, we will provide you with an NP-context co-occurrence matrix and
    ask you to do something interesting with it. Possible applications include finding
    synonyms, finding members of categories (i.e., "is this noun phrase an athlete?"),
    or clustering noun phrases to automatically induce categories. For more ideas, we
    recommend reading (1).<br />
    <br />
    Another interesting set of projects could use this data as a case study for
    learning in high-dimensions. These projects could examine how dimensionality
    reduction or regularization affect performance on one of the above tasks.<br />
    <br />
    Vector space models are also used for many other tasks, including document
    classification and topic modeling. The 20 Newsgroups data is a classic data set for
    these tasks. You can obtain <a href=

    <td align="justify"><b>Semi-Supervised Learning </b><br />
    <br />
    In many applications, it is easy to obtain a large amount of unlabeled data, but
    difficult or costly to label this data. Semi-supervised learning studies algorithms
    which learn from a small amount of labeled data and a large pool of unlabeled data.
    Interestingly, semi-supervised learning is not always successful, and unlabeled
    data points do not always improve performance. Semi-supervised learning algorithms
    typically make an assumption about the data distribution which enables learning --
    for example, several algorithms assume that the decision boundary should not pass
    through regions with high data density. When this assumption is satisfied, the
    algorithms perform better than supervised learning.<br />
    <br />
    The goal of this project is to experiment with semi-supervised learning algorithms
    on a data set of your choice. Some algorithms you can consider using are:
    co-training, self-training, transductive SVMS (S3VMs), or one of the many
    graph-based algorithms. (We recommend reading (1) for a survey of the many
    approaches to semi-supervised learning.) You may compare several semi-supervised
    and supervised algorithms on your data set, and perhaps draw some general
    conclusions about semi-supervised learning.<br />
    <br />
    This project can use essentially any data set. For some ideas, we recommend
    consulting the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine Learning
    Repository</a>.<br />

    <td align="justify"><b>Privacy-Related Project Ideas</b><br />
    <br />
    A recent paper shows how decision trees may be approximated in the "secure
    multiparty" setting, by using tools of cryptography. This allows several parties to
    compute a decision tree on the union of their data without requiring them to share
    the data itself with each other. See <a href=
    "http://www.pinkas.net/PAPERS/id3-final.pdf">here</a> for the algorithm and
    <a href="http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=jpc">
    here</a> for a general discussion.<br />
    <br />
    An alternative notion of privacy which has received much attention lately is
    so-called "Differential Privacy" (see e.g, <a href=
    "http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/databaseprivacy/dwork.pdf">here</a>.
    So far approaches have been studied for many machine learning methods under this
    model of privacy (such as logistic regression: see <a href=
    "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0071">here</a> and svm: see <a href=
    "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.5708">here</a>. This notion of privacy is fundamentally
    different to the usual cryptographic one.<br />
    <br />
    The datasets for this project can be found at the <a href=
    "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html">UCI machine learning archive</a>
    (Please consult Rob Hall for more details about the datasets.).<br />
    <br />
    <u>Project Idea 1: Differentially Private Decision Trees</u><br />
    See whether it is possible to implement a decision tree learner in a
    differentially-private way. This would entail creating a randomized algorithm which
    outputs a decision tree. Furthermore, when one of the elements of the input data is
    changed, the distribution over the outputs should not change by much (cf, the
    definition of differential privacy). Analyze under what conditions the approach
    will work and analyze the error rate relative to that of the non-private decision
    tree.<br />
    <br />
    <u>Project Idea 2: Secure Multiparty EM</u><br />
    Implement EM for some kind of mixture model in a secure multiparty way (i.e.,
    making use of cryptography to protect the intermediate quantities). This has been
    studied already in the context of imputation (see <a href=
    "http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~rwright1/Publications/padm06.pdf">here</a>). Although
    in principle, existing cryptographic primitives may be used to compute any
    funciton, in order to get a reasonably efficient algorithm you will have to come up
    with approximations which are less expensive to compute. Analyze the effects of any
    such approximations you make.<br />
    <br />
    <u>Project Idea 3: Differentially Private Sparse Covariance Estimation</u><br />
    The estimation of gaussian covariance matrices has received ample attention lately
    (see e.g, <a href=
    "http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=euclid.ejs/1214491853">
    here</a>). When the covariance matrix is sparse (i.e., the off-diagonal elements
    are mostly 0) then there is a nice correspondence between the multivariate
    gaussian, and a certain type of undirected graphical model. See whether it is
    possible to estimate sparse covariance matrices in a way which satisfies the
    definition of differential privacy as shown above. Analyze how much error will be
    in the algorithm compared with the non-private one.<br />

    <td align="justify"><b>KDD cup 2010 (Provided by Datashop in Pittsburgh Science
    Learning Center)</b><br />
    <br />
    The KDD Cup is the annual Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery competition in which
    some of the best data mining teams in the world compete to solve an practical data
    mining problem of some importance. The 2010 challenge was about discovering how
    generally or narrowly do students learn? How quickly or slowly? Will the rate of
    improvement vary between students? What does it mean for one problem to be similar
    to another? It might depend on whether the knowledge required for one problem is
    the same as the knowledge required for another. But is it possible to infer the
    knowledge requirements of problems directly from student performance data, without
    human analysis of the tasks? This year's challenge asks you to predict student
    performance on mathematical problems from logs of student interaction with
    Intelligent Tutoring Systems. This task presents interesting technical challenges,
    has practical importance, and is scientifically interesting.<br />

    <u>Project Idea 1:</u><br />
    For each dataset, you can compare various machine learning techniques (at least
    five to seven different ML methods) on predicting "Correct First Attempt values"
    (Generally listed in the column "Outcome"). Please report the Root Mean Squared
    Error (RMSE).<br />
    <br />
    <u>Project Idea 2:</u><br />
    Across datasets, you can compare several machine learning techniques (at least two
    to three different ML methods) on predicting "Correct First Attempt
    values"(Generally listed in the column "Outcome"). Please report the Root Mean
    Squared Error (RMSE) on the test data. The hypothesis here is that there may not be
    an absolute winner, different machine learning techniques may be effective on
    different task domains. For example, you can split the datasets into science
    (physics &amp; math) vs. second language learning (Chinese, French).<br />

    <b>Image Segmentation Dataset</b><br />
    The goal is to segment images in a meaningful way. Berkeley collected three hundred
    images and paid students to hand-segment each one (usually each image has multiple
    hand-segmentations). Two-hundred of these images are training images, and the
    remaining 100 are test images. The dataset includes code for reading the images and
    ground-truth labels, computing the benchmark scores, and some other utility
    functions. It also includes code for a segmentation example. This dataset is new
    and the problem unsolved, so there is a chance that you could come up with the
    leading algorithm for your project.<br />

    <br />
    <u>Project idea:</u> Region-Based Segmentation<br />
    Most segmentation algorithms have focused on segmentation based on edges or based
    on discontinuity of color and texture. The ground-truth in this dataset, however,
    allows supervised learning algorithms to segment the images based on statistics
    calculated over regions. One way to do this is to "oversegment" the image into
    superpixels (Felzenszwalb 2004, code available) and merge the superpixels into
    larger segments. Graphical models can be used to represent smoothness in clusters,
    by adding appropriate potentials between neighboring pixels. In this project, you
    can address, for example, learning of such potentials, and inference in models with
    very large tree-width.<br />

    <td align="justify"><b>Character recognition (digits) data</b><br />
    Optical character recognition, and the simpler digit recognition task, has been the
    focus of much ML research. We have two datasets on this topic. The first tackles
    the more general OCR task, on a small vocabulary of words: (Note that the first
    letter of each word was removed, since these were capital letters that would make
    the task harder for you.)<br />

    <br />
    Project suggestion:<br />
    * Use an HMM to exploit correlations between neighboring letters in the general OCR
    case to improve accuracy. (Since ZIP codes don't have such constraints between
    neighboring digits, HMMs will probably not help in the digit case.)<br />
