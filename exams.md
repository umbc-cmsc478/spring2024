This page will be updated shortly before the midterm and final exams to reflect what we actually covered this semester.

# Midterm exam

## <span style="color:blue">Reading Guide: </span>
Listed below are the minimum things you should be prepared to do. This is not an all-inclusive list, but you should at least be prepared to do these things:

### Homework 1 and 2 
**==> Logistic Regression, Linear Regression**
- How do you update the parameters for linear/logistic regression?
- What is the cost function and what is the log-likelihood?

**==> Naive Bayes (NB), Laplace smoothing**
- How to estimate parameters for likelihood functions using bayes rule?
- How to calculate/ predict class labels in generative models?
- How do you handle continuous and discrete X in NB?

### Generative vs discriminative
- how many parameters needed for generative classifiers, 
- how does NB assumption improves it,
- how do you calculate conditional probabilities from joint probabilities?


<!-- ### Kernel
    Stanford lecture notes (SML) 5.1, 5.2, 5.4 (page 53, 54, 55)

- Focus on What kinds of functions K(·, ·) can correspond to some feature map φ?
- How to calculate φ(x) from x?
- How to calculate the weight-parameters (w/theta) given the decision function? You will find examples in the sample exams

### SVM
- Impact of offset, impact of C and slack variable (slides show examples) -->

### Bias - variance, and Cross-validation
- How is model complexity connected to bias, variance, and test error?
- How does L1 and L2 regularization affect classifiers?
- How does cross-validation help us to better generalize?

### Multiclass classification
- How is Multiclass classification connected to Logistic Regression (the general idea)
- what is their loss (how do you train multiclass)? 

## <span style="color:blue">Sample Questions </span>
I am providing a sample exam. Please be reminded that not all the topics in the questions have been convered in our classes. You can ignore them.
